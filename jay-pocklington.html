                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <div class="bio-content">
                    <p>Jay Pocklington serves as Director of the Institute for New Economic Thinking's Young Scholars Initiative (YSI), where he plays a pivotal role in fostering the next generation of economic thinkers and researchers. His journey with INET began after helping to organize the YSI Commons program at the influential 2012 Plenary Conference in Berlin, demonstrating his early commitment to advancing innovative economic discourse and collaboration among young scholars worldwide.</p>
                    
                    <p>Pocklington's academic foundation was built at Freie Universit√§t Berlin, where he earned both B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in economics while actively contributing to the academic community as a teaching and research assistant. His leadership capabilities were recognized early when he was elected as a student representative in the Business and Economics Department Council, reflecting his dedication to academic governance and student advocacy.</p>
                    
                    <p>His scholarly interests focus on economic history and policy analysis, exemplified by his Master's thesis, "Behind the Curtain of the Old Wizard: The German Economic Recovery under Hjalmar Schacht 1933-1938." This research explores the complex economic recovery during the early National Socialist period, providing critical insights into the economic thinking and policies of Hjalmar Schacht, the influential head of the German Reichsbank. Through his work at YSI, Pocklington continues to bridge historical economic analysis with contemporary policy challenges, supporting emerging economists in developing innovative approaches to understanding monetary and financial systems.</p>
